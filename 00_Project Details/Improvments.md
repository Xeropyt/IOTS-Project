## Potential Improvements

### 1. Hosting the website on a cloud server. Removes the ability to stop the system by bringing down the database. 

An Example of this would be by using Firebase Hosting which we have tested:

a. Download firebase libraries using npm

b. run the command Firebase Login and input your details

c. change the directory to the file that contain your html,css, and js files

### 2. Password requirements. This is due to the limitations of firebase as we are using it for data encryption.
